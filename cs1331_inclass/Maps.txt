Backing of a Map could be Array of Pairs where a Pair Object holds the designated generics the Map is initialized with.
Hash code is the Array Index ?


Put method takes a key value
Calls hash code of Key
Uses that value to determine which bucket to put it in (hashCode % arraySize)


This is why retrevial time for HashMap and HashCodes is super fast

int result = 17;
result 31 * result + color.hasCode();
return restulr;
